## **DTR: Define the Relationship**

**What are each of our learning goals for this project? What drives us in this project?**<br/>
To create an interactive game that includes tests along with a class file with methods that support them. We're driven by an eagerness to learn.

**What is your collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?**<br/>
Our collaboration style is ping-pong style. We'll both contribute in equal parts. Pair programming will allow us to have a better comprehension of our program and the inner workings of it. We are anti divide-and-conquer approach.

**How do you communicate best? How do you appreciate receiving communication from others?**<br/>
We are both direct and honest communicators which we believe will serve us well as we work through this project together. Luckily, we are similiar in that we give and receive direct and honest communication well. 

**How would you describe your work style?**<br/>
We are both hard workers and are looking forward to staying diligent in completing the task at hand. 

**What are each of our strengths? How can our strengths complement each other?**<br/>
Sarah is great at asking pointed questions early and often to work through hurdles. Mitch is great at putting in the time and utilizing google research to assist in learning. We will complement each other through playing off of our individual strengths to make a stronger pair.

**What’s gone well or poorly in your previous projects?**<br/>
In previous projects, a strong start to assignments helps to allow more time for comprehension. 

**How will we set direction and make decisions as a team?**<br/>
We are great at communicating and setting clear goals as a team. We collaborate well together and are able to make decisions quickly.

**How will we overcome obstacles?**<br/>
With our direct and honest communication as well as our ability to reach out beyond the scope of our group for clarity if necessary. 

**What do you need (resources, environment, communication) to do your best work?**<br/>
Periods of focused activity mixed with the appropriate amount of poms and agreed upon breaks to allow our brains to absorb what we're working on. 

**What scheduling restraints do you have? What are your scheduling preferences?**<br/>
None. We'll communicate scheduling preferences as necessary.

**What is your style for giving feedback? Does anything ever hold you back from giving feedback?**<br/>
Constructive criticism mixed with positive feedback. 

**What do you identify as being your biggest strength(s) (as a team) technically, as they relate to this project? Where do you feel you could use improvement in your technical skills, as they relate to this project? How can our team help support you in improving these skills?**<br/>
We are great at reaching out for help early and often and utilizing online resources as we are relatively* inexperienced coders. We are working on learning the interactive phase of writing a program. Mitch and I are at a similar level so I think we will help support each other in the learning process. The Turing team can help support us on improving these skills by continuing to answer our questions and pointing us in the right direction for success.

**What tools do you want to use to manage the project?**<br/>
We will utilize google and past projects and assignments we've done in class as a tool to help manage the project.

**How do you want the group to solve problems when members run into issues with features of the project?**<br/>
We will brainstorm together, utilize google, cohort mates, tutor, and mentors to help us through obstacles.

**How do you know if a project is successful? How can we achieve that as a group?**<br/>
We'll know it is successful when both the journey and the outcome are teaching us to be better coders. We will achieve this as a group through overcoming hurdles together. 

**How will we recognize each other's successes and celebrate them?**<br/>
By taking small bitesize chunks and celebrating small wins as we move along through the project. High fives!

#**Remote Work Considerations During the COVID-19 Quarantine**#<br/>
**What does remote focus look like for you? (headphones, distractions minimized (tv, family stuff, etc), video on)**<br/>
Both of us are in a designated office spaces with minimal distractions which will serve us well. 

**When working from the same place where you live, life can get in the way. What are some potential life things that could affect your ability to focus, and what plan can we come up with to approach those moments?**<br/>
FOMO, but we are committed to making Turing our #1 priority. 

**If we encounter issues such as power outages, Zoom difficulties, or bad wifi, what backup plans can we have in place? (This could have answers like asking a neighbor to borrow wifi, using cellphone hotspot for internet, switching to slack or skype.**<br/>
We'll be prepared to address those issues when we come to them. We do have each other's phone numbers, so the line of communication will remain open to resolve any issues that might come up. 

**Pomodoro breaks are especially important for remote work and doubly so for quarantine. What should our Pom cadence look like? How will hold ourselves accountable?**<br/>
We agree that a solid work session of ~45 minutes should be followed by a ~5 minute pom. We'll be sure to use the Marinara chrome extension. 

**Quarantine is tough, so it’s important to make note of our mental/emotional state when working with others. How can we make space to check in on each other’s well being, in addition to the work that needs to be done?**<br/>
Luckily, Mitch and I built a great working relationship through Mod 0, so we are very comfortable reaching out to one another when things get a little rough. 

**Group Member Names**<br/>
Mitchell Standley
Sarah Rudy

**Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?):**<br/>
We are both eager to learn and to gain a better understanding of the material. We would like to complete and be fluent in at least the first 3 iterations of the project. We will view this project as a success if we both are able to cement the concepts we've learned along the journey. 

**Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here):**<br/>
It's a strength that we are both at a similar comprehension level so we are able to overcome obstacles and learn together as a team. After discussing our Parin results, we discovered that we are similar but different and complement each other well. 

**How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles:**<br/>
We will use our strengths to overcome obstacles by knowing our strengths well and how to utilize them as we work through the project together.

**Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have? Make sure to discuss the remote questions above in regards to this section):**<br/>
Fortunately, we are both committed to keeping our schedules open and we have limited outside commitments. 

**Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team? How will we communicate about our emotional and mental well-being with each other?):**<br/>
REVISIT

**Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):**<br/>
Being able to iterate over all files we create, call on methods within those files, understand the full scope, working through the interaction phase of the project. 

**Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):**<br/>
REVISIT

**Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques):**<br/>
We'll both need practice with creating and reviewing pull requests in a collaboration project. 

**Pomodoro Break Schedule:**<br/>
45 min/ 5 min 

**Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:**<br/>
Being honest, open, and kind and receiving constructive criticism as a means for learning.

**Additional Remote Considerations:**<br/>
None.

**Project management tools we will use (GitHub projects or Trello are popular tools):**<br/>
We will explore using GitHub projects. At surface level, it looks like it will be a good tool to keep us organized and on track. 

**Day 1 Agenda:**<br/>
- DTR 
- Review "Battleship - Overview"
- Get some files and classes set up 
- Write out general plan of attack
